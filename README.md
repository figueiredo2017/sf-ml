Film Locations in San Francisco
---------------

This app display in a user-friendly way the Film Locations in San Francisco.

The app was designed to work with the dataset provided by
[DataSF : Film Locations in San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am).

I decided to not implement any database and use the data provided in the API.
